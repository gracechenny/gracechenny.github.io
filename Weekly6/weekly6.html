    <title>Weekly 6: Xenofeminism</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Xenofeminism</h1>
    <h2>Natural Order? Sex? Gender? Race? Class? <span class="Canceled">Canceled.</span> </h2>
    <h3>What is the purpose of XENOFEMINISM?</h3>
    <p> Xenofeminism is "the insertion of a topological-keyframe for the formation of a new logic." They want to construct an entirely new and "alien" future by transforming today's Eurocentric universalism.
       Xenofeminism aims to eradicate the ideological structures of capitialism, whiteness, and patriarchy. They want to explore the untapped potential of technology and use it to transform gender, sexuality, and other sources of power disparity. </p>
    <h3>What do they mean by "let a hundres sexes bloom"?</h3>
    <p>This statement points to Xenofeminists' committment to the eradication of gender as a gatekeeper of power. They want to abolish the idea of gender as it currently is, and replace it with free and fluid human expression of any combination of currently gendered traits.</p>
    <h3> What do you think the role of gender will be in the future?</h3>
    <p>While this paper/manifesto argues to not be melancholy, I cannot see a future where gender will truly expand beyond the binary and sex be deemed irrelevant. The idea of sex as "natural" and society's attachement to what is "natural" is too strong.
    Natural will continue to be seen as absolute and I cannot see how this idea will be destablized on a mass scale. I can imagine a future where the gender binary is more fluid, and both toxic masculinity and feminity rising to the public consciousness further.
  However, these traits will still be characterized as feminine and masculine, not merely toxic.  </p>
