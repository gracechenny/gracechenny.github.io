  <h1>Poor Images: Visual Bonds of Not Just the Working Class?</h1>
  <p> Prior to reading, I've never thought of images as existing in a hierachy.
    Of course, in my head I've always characterized images in a hierachy subconsciously. I give less merit to "poor images", no matter their content, partially because
    of the way they are distributed and regulated. Despite some low-resolution Instagram
    photos with friends and family being my favorites, I would never print them out and frame them.
    They will instead always exist in the space of the internet cloud, destined to be eventually forgotten when
    Instagram invetiably becomes vestigal. How poor images are distributed and relegated are a direct result of their resolution,
    a physical property. Even their name is a result of their materiality. However,
    I never considered valuing them based on their speed and velocity. The higher the circulation/speed, typically the lower the quality of digital imagery.
    Conversely however, the higher the political power and accessibility. Memes,
    the most ready example of "poor images" in my head, are a good example of such a "poor image".
    Memes encourage audience members to become producers in their own right. (Pro-sumers).
    The most common visual bonds amongst not only the working class, but almost everyone may be memes. Poor images are truly the “language of the people”, regardless of class.
