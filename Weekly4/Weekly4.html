  <h3>
    What was the cultural impact of cybernetics?
  </h3>
    <p>Positive Impact: Rise of hippie communes, political egalitarian movements, the birth of the internet
    <br>Negative Impact: Justification for continuation of existing oppressive systems. Segregationist movements, etc.</p>
  <h3>Do you think humans can be understood through cybernetics? </h3>
  <p>No cybernetics do not allow for change, which is natural for humanity. </p>
  <h3>Is cybernetics a useful tool for describing reality?</h3>
  <p>No, it is only useful for planning really, if that. Reality may very well be the opposite of cybernetics . There is no equilibrium or “default setting” in the real world, are we really returning towards anything?</p>
